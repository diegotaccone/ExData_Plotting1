Hi!

Some help to review my work.

1. I added the script for how the data is loaded into R and how the data is organized before plotting this script is called readpowerdatacode.r.

2. You need to lead de dplyr package.

3. There is a Script for each plot code and a 480x480 PNG file for each plot.

4. Each code plots first in the graphic device, and later copies to a png file.
